# hello-world
My name is Shinyoung Lee (Mark) and I am currently a rising senior attending SPPS in Seoul, South Korea. I am interested in medical biology, engineering, and computer science. Aside from that, I like reading classical Chinese texts and mulling over the classic literature. 

This is my first experience with making a repo.

It is a little bit hard to use these for the first time, but I am sure things will go well as I try my best to improve upon my skills and expand my toolbox.
