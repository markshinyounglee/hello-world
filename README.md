# hello-world
My name is Shinyoung Lee (Mark) and I am currently a rising senior attending SPPS in Seoul, South Korea. I am interested in medical biology, engineering, and computer science. Aside from that, I like reading classical Chinese texts and mulling over the classic literature. 

This is my first experience with making a repo.
